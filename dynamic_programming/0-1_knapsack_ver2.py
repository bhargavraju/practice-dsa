"""
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and
weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer C which
represents knapsack capacity. Find out the maximum value subset of A such that
sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

NOTE: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or
donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 500
1 <= C, B[i] <= 10^6
1 <= A[i] <= 50
"""


# Issue with traditional knapsack approach her is the constraints. Since the
# max possible value for each weight is 10^6, time complexity would be too high
# So we use value as the second dimension with dp[i][j] representing the min
# weight necessary to achieve 'j' profit/value with i elements

# first column is 0 as to achieve 0 profit/value, we need 0 min weight
# first row is infinite as to achieve positive profit/value with no elements
# is not possible and is represented by infinite capacity

    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : list of integers
    # @param C : integer
    # @return an integer
